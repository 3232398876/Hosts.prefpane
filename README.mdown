## Hosts, a system preference pane to manage your hosts file.

Hosts add a preference pane to your system preferences which lets you toggle your
host file entries on and off, as well as add and remove them.

Hosts.prefpane likes to keep your hosts file clean. When an entry is toggled off,
it is not commented out in the hosts file, but instead stored in the app's
preferences storage. This means you will have to uncomment all your unused host
entries and untoggle them in the prefpane if you want to use them. Comments are
treated as comments and will never show up in the list of host entries!

Of course Hosts.prefpane will detect edits you made to the ``/etc/hosts`` directly and
merge them into the listing.

Backups of your hosts file is made in ``~/Library/Application Support/Hosts``.
The backup or your hosts file from before you started using Hosts.prefpane is
called *hosts.orig* and each session a backup is made called *hosts.session*.

The default host entries that are needed by the OS are hidden and can not be
edited using Hosts.prefpane.

##  Compiling Parser
To compile the parser protion of the Hosts PrefPane, you need to have ``bison`` installed somewhere. The current compiler setting expects bison to be in ``/usr/local/opt/bison/bin/``. This is where [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installs it (``brew install bison``).

## Where is the Preference Pane?
You'll find the preference pane in the Products folder of the Xcode project. Just copy it to the PreferencePanes folder of your Mac.
