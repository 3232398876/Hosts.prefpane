Bison path setting in parser target:

Original path: /opt/local/bin/bison
Homebrew path: /usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison


Localization:

- Done with BartyCrouch (https://github.com/Flinesoft/BartyCrouch)
- Project folder contains setup-file .bartycrouch.toml
- To update, run "bartycrouch update" in the project folder
- Known Issue: Localized strings are not used in preference pane, only in app.


Notarization:

You cannot select the archive of a pref pane for notarization, this is why I made an installer. I did it along these steps:

Find out your developer identities:
security find-identity -p basic -v

Note the one called "Developer ID Application". I will refer to the actual name with "Your Name (ABCDEFG1234)".

Sign the pane:
codesign -v -f -s "Developer ID Application: Your Name (ABCDEFG1234)" Hosts.prefPane

Build Package (pane in folder "build"):
pkgbuild --root build --identifier "nl.your-domain.hosts" --version "1.4.5" --install-location "/Library/PreferencePanes" --sign "Developer ID Installer: Your Name (ABCDEFG1234)" Hosts-PrefPane-1.4.5.pkg

To certify the installer, you need your ProviderShortname. For this, you have to give altool its app-specific password:
xcrun altool --list-providers -u "your.name@your-domain.nl" -p "@keychain:Developer-altool"

Certify package:
xcrun altool --notarize-app --primary-bundle-id "nl.your-domain.hosts" --username "your.name@your-domain.nl" --password "@keychain:Developer-altool" --asc-provider "YourName123456" --file "Hosts-PrefPane-1.4.5.pkg"

Wait, check status:
xcrun altool --notarization-info "YourRequestUUID" --username "your.name@your-domain.nl" --password "@keychain:Developer-altool"

Staple notarization ticket to package for offline installation:
xcrun stapler staple Hosts-PrefPane-1.4.5.pkg
